# Global-Co2-Emissions
Analysis of Co2 Emissions by various countries and comparing factors such as Life Expectancy, PerCapita Emissions.....s 

Conclusion
Thus in the course of the analysis, it was established which countries emit the highest/least Percapita Emission of Co2, which countries have the most/least Yearly change in emission, which countires have the most/least Life Expectancy. In addition, it was found that Percapita Emission have a significant relation with Life Expectancy of countries, however it is not the only significant factor. As it depends on many other factors such as Health Infrastucture, measures taken for curbing the emitted Co2 and much more.
